# OIBSIP_Python_Task3 😁

## 🎯Objective
The objective of this project is to build a **command-line random password generator** in Python that creates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria such as password length and allowed character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

## 🚶🏿‍♂️Steps Performed
1. Collected user input for desired **password length** and preferred character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
2. Implemented **input validation** to ensure password length is reasonable and at least one character set is selected.
3. Defined character pools:
   - Alphabets (uppercase and lowercase)
   - Digits
   - Special symbols
4. Used Python’s **random module** to generate a password string from the selected character sets.
5. Displayed the generated random password to the user.
6. Tested the program with different criteria to ensure robustness and security.

## 💻Tools Used
- **Python** (programming language)  
- **Random module** (for generating random characters)  
- **String module** (for handling predefined character sets)  

## 🔑Outcome
- Successfully created a **random password generator** that adapts to user-defined requirements.  
- Users can generate strong, customized passwords quickly and securely.  
- The project demonstrates randomization, input validation, and string manipulation in Python, making it a practical beginner-level security utility.
